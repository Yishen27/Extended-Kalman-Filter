# Extended-Kalman-Filter
----
This is a Udacity project aimming at generating an Extended-Kalman-Filter program that can predict the status of a moving object according to
radar and lidar data. The codes takes in radar and lidar data, . When connected to 
the simulator, the network is capable of returning a steering angle according to the curve to drive the car in the simulator.


## Model structure
The model mainly applied a nerual network applied in self-driving car of Nvidia cooperation.The architecture includes 5 convolutional 
layers with ReLu as activation function,a flatten layer and 4 fully connected layers. More detail can be found in the code and writeup.md.

## Model performance
The network trained by the code was able to drive the simulated car in the center of the lane most of the time without leaving the lane
, no matter how the road was curved, and was capable of adjusting itself from over or under turning. The result can be found in the **run.mp4**.
